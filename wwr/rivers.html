            <p class="introduction">From the enormous Amazon river in Africa, to the small Cress Creek in Idaho, rivers are beautiful parts of nature.
                And are vital components when planning your rafting adventure.

                <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
                
                <p>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
                </p>
                    <p>Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. 
                    The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. 
                    As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early 
                    summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer.

                <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
                    <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. 
                    </p>
                    <p>his 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.
                        Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days
                        Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.

                <h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
                    <p>This is the grand daddy of all canyons. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.
                        Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.
                    </p>
                    <p>CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.

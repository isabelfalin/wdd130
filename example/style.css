/* 
   1. Setup the container to be a grid and define the columns and rows.
      You can either use pixel measurements, percents, "fr" or "auto".
      "fr" means, divide up the space evenly
      "auto" means, make it as big as you need to fit the stuff.

			Make two columns, each 300px wide:
         grid-template-columns: 300px 300px;

			Make three columns:
         grid-template-columns: 100px 500px 300px;

      Make three columns that divide the space evenly between them:
         grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;

      Make three columns that divide the space evenly between them, 
      but the middle columns gets twice the space as the others:
         grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;

      Make three columns, the first 100px, the second as big as needs to 
      be to fit its contents, and the third take up the rest of the space:
         grid-template-columns: 300px auto 1fr;

            <!-- The 'ancient snow rides' bit will be in bold -->
            <h4>Ancient Snow Rides: The concept of sliding on snow can be traced back thousands of years. Cultures in regions with heavy snowfall, such as the Inuit and the people of Scandinavia, used sled-like devices to travel across snow-covered landscapes. 
                These early forms of snow travel are considered the ancestors of modern snowboarding.</h4>

            <h2>The 1920s-1930s:</h2>
            <h4>The idea of strapping one's feet to a board to slide down snow-covered hills began to 
                take form in the early 20th century. In 1929, Sherman Poppen created the "snurfer," 
                a toy for his daughter that resembled a snowboard but without bindings. 
                This marked the first real precursor to modern snowboarding.</h4>

            <h2>The Birth of Modern Snowboarding (1960s-1970s): 1960s:</h2>
            <h4>In the 1960s, surfing culture began influencing snowboarding. 
                Early enthusiasts like Tom Sims and Jake Burton Carpenter started experimenting 
                with designs that would resemble the modern snowboard. Burton is particularly 
                famous for creating the first commercially viable snowboard in the mid-1970s.</h4>
            
            <h4>1970s: Jake Burton's company (Burton Snowboards) was founded in 1977 and became a 
                pioneer in making snowboards more functional. Burton's innovations, 
                like adding bindings to the board, made the sport more accessible and 
                paved the way for it to evolve.</h4>
